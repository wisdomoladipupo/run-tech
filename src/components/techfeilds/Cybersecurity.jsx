            To get started on your cyber security journey, it's important to
            comprehend the terrain, show interest in the industry, examine the
            options and career routes accessible, then build a strong foundation
            of knowledge and investigate the many career possibilities. Here are
            the first actions I thought about taking: 1. Explore the Cyber
            Security Landscape: Read industry blogs and websites like Dark
            Reading, Krebs on Security, The Hacker News and SecurityWeek to
            immerse yourself in the realm of cybersecurity. Joining

            internet functions, including how user requests are handled and how
            issues are managed. Learn the fundamentals of solid computer
            networking. You can take free classes to learn about TCP/IP, network
            protocols, and data flow through networks at websites like Cisco
            Networking Academy, Cybrary, and TryHackMe. There are several
            YouTubers, like Professor Messer, Farah Hawa, The Cyber Mentor, and
            many others, who can assist you in understanding the ideas. Learn
            how operating systems function. These operating systems' free online
            guides and tutorials can provide you a firm foundation in ideas like
            file systems, permissions, and command-line interfaces. Over the
            course of your cyber security career, Linux will become your best

            Elements of Security. If you’ve reached this far, it surely means
            that you’ve developed a keen interest in the field of cyber
            security. These could be the most important months to accelerate
            learning. It is crucial to develop a solid foundation of knowledge
            in security concepts and technology. To create a solid
            understanding, concentrate on the following areas. Delve into the
            essential concepts of cybersecurity, including Confidentiality,
            Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization and more.
            Free resources such as the "Cybersecurity Essentials" course on
            Cybrary or the "Introduction to Cybersecurity" course on
            FutureLearn, the TryHackMe platform can provide a solid foundation.
            Paid resources like TCM Security’s courses or the eLearnSecurity’s
            Penetration Testing Student Course as well as certification can be
            found immensely useful to get the kickstart to the career in cyber
            security. Dive into the fascinating realm of encryption and
            cryptography. Free resources like Cryptography tutorials on Khan
            Academy or the "Cryptography I" course offered by Stanford
            University on Coursera or even the YouTube channels can help you
            understand encryption algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric
            cryptography, and cryptographic protocols. Develop familiarity with
            crucial security technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection
            systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure web
            protocols (HTTPS). Free resources from vendors like Cisco, Palo Alto
            Networks, and Fortinet can provide documentation and tutorials. Even
            the TryHackMe provides with good quality of explanation to the
            topics mentioned. Understand common web vulnerabilities, including
            cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and CSRF attacks. Free
            resources such as the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
            guides and tutorials or PortSwigger's Web Security Academy can
            deepen your knowledge. For comprehensive learning, premium course
            like "Web Application Penetration Testing" on eLearnSecurity.

            used scripting language these days. Various free resources are
            available to get the hands dirty with the python programming. 2.
            Dedicate Time and Effort to the Mastery of Ethical Hacking
            Practices: Delve into the exciting world of ethical hacking and
            penetration testing. Free resources like the Metasploit Unleashed
            project, OWASP's "WebGoat" or "Juice Shop", Vulnhub platform are
            some of the vulnerable applications and platforms which offer
            practical platforms to practice hacking techniques. Practical
            experience is invaluable in the cybersecurity field. Engage in
            Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges available on platforms like Hack
            The Box, TryHackMe, or OverTheWire's Bandit. Additionally, practice
            on deliberately vulnerable virtual machines like Metasploitable,
            OWASP BWA, or Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to apply your
            skills in realistic scenarios. 3. Explore Defensive Security: While
            ethical hacking is essential, understanding defensive security
            measures is equally important. Free resources like "Security
            Operations" courses on Cybrary or the "Introduction to Incident
            Response" course on FutureLearn can provide insights. For
            comprehensive learning, premium courses such as "Security Operations
            and Incident Response" on Pluralsight or the "Certified Incident
            Handler (GCIH)" course offered by SANS Institute are highly
            recommended.
